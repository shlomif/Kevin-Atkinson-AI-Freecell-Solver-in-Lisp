<p>
For CMSC671 (Graduate level A.I) we were required to "design,
implement, demonstrate, evaluate, and report on a working AI system in
Lisp that combines significant components of the course."  Our group
decided to implement a freecell solver.  I ended up writing almost all
the code and my partner ended up writing most of the report.  Because
our solver is rather unique I decided to release the code under the <a
href="gpl.txt">GPL</a>.  In general, our solutions are shorter than
those found by a comparable Free Cell solver found at <a
href="http://vipe.technion.ac.il/~shlomif/freecell-solver">http://vipe.technion.ac.il/~shlomif/freecell-solver</a>,
although the a-star search found in that package seems to do better
with some of the most difficult games.  It should work with any ANSI
Common List implementation; however because the search is
computationally intense using clisp or some other interpretative lisp
implantation is not recommend unless you enjoy waiting for ever.  Of
the two compiled Lisp implementations tried, Allegro and CMUCL, CMUCL
gives the best performance.  The final code has only been tested with
CMUCL.
